# EdgeUninstaller

❗ATTENTION❗

==================================================================================================================

- This file is in beta version so some error can occur when you execute the file.

- You need to run the file in Administrator for the file to run correctly.

- The two folders "Registry" and "CMD" is not the system folders. It shows the way that you use to uninstall Edge.

- For Registry method, it doesn't uninstall Edge directly like the CMD method, but it's safer than the CMD method.

- If you use Registry method, you need to uninstall Edge in Settings or Control Panel later on.

==================================================================================================================

IF YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS TO UNINSTALL EDGE, I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU TO USE THE REGISTRY METHOD.
